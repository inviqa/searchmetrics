<h3>Green Goblin We are who we choose to be... now, CHOOSE.</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You have a knack for getting in trouble.</li>
    <li>You have a knack for saving my life. I think I have a superhero stalker.</li>
    <li>I was in the neighborhood.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spider Man will always have enemies. I can't let you take that risk.</h2>

<blockquote>
    Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: "With great power comes great responsibility."
    This is my gift, my curse.

    Who am I? I'm Spiderman.
